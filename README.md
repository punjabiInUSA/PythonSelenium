<b>Overview:</b> Developed scripts to assist entering absence details (dates, country, reason) on Canadian immigration portal
### Pre-requisites:
1. Have an active account with CIC
2. Install Python and required packages (Selenium, openpyxl, webDriver (depends on your preferred browser) )
3. Make sure that you have answered the initial questions and can manually navigate to the main page where absence details are entered, for both scripts (cicPhysicalPresenceCitznPortal and cicPhysicalPresence). Hope it helps!
